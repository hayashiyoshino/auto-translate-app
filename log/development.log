After starting a one-man business selling motorcycle parts, he decided to pivot into goggles and eyewear. Fast forward about 25 years, and Oakley had become one of the biggest sunglass brands in the world. Then in 2007, after selling Oakley for $2.1 billion, Jannard turned to his other company, and that same year, Red shipped its first 4K cinema-grade digital camera. Both companies are highly successful ventures by any definition, so for his third pivot, Jannard thought he would set his sights even higher and make a smartphone unlike anything else on the market. But this time, I think Jim may have gone a little too far because instead of making something you might want to buy, the Red Hydrogen One, with its ambitious 3D display, feels like a phone that teleported from a different dimension.A phone with a 3D screen made by the people who make Red camerasStarts at $1,295Very solid build, dedicated camera button, has a headphone jackOutdated specs, super expensive, lackluster camera, modularity doesn\'t work yet, and the screen isn\'t actually all that revolutionaryAdvertisementCrafted from a scalloped aluminum frame and Kevlar panels (a titanium-clad model coming soon), the Hydrogen One looks like a tank and feels even heavier. It has ribbed grooves running down its back and sides that you can grate cheese on, and in back there’s a red jewel surrounded by engraved metal that reads Red Media Machine. All this combines to deliver a kind of rarefied durability, and it’s the first time in a long while I feel like there’s a phone that will never need a case to stay safe. In short, the Hydrogen One is the complete antithesis to the modern glass sandwich smartphone.But the outlandishness doesn’t stop there, because in addition to a USB-C port for data and charging, the Hydrogen One features a (gasp) headphone jack and a microSD card tray that you can pull out with your fingernail, rather than relying on one of those tiny tray ejector pins that instantly disappears the second you get a new phone. And on its sides, in addition to separate buttons for volume up and down, there’s a lock button on the right with a built-in fingerprint reader and a dedicated camera button—very fitting for a phone made by Red.AdvertisementAll of this is just preamble to the Hydrogen One’s highlight feature: its 4View display. So what does 4View stand for? I’m not totally sure and Red’s website doesn’t exactly spell it out either. But what 4View supposedly delivers is pretty out there. 4View is what Red claims to be the “world’s first holographic screen,” and its components include all the hottest buzzwords. It’s powered by nanotechnology via a unique Lightfield screen which promises immersive 3D images without the need for glasses. (For those that want to know more about how 4View actually works, check out this interview with one of the creators of the tech here.)Sadly, those fancy words and added depth don’t come across in normal pictures or videos, which means it’s something that can only be experienced in person. And to me, the Hydrogen One’s display is really just a slightly better version of what you’d get on a new Nintendo 3DS. And it’s true, even without glasses, images do seem to leap off the screen and hover in mid-air, but it’s not the sort of revolutionary display I was expecting to see after over a year of hype.In my opinion, still images using the technology look better than videos, with photos featuring things with hard lines like a sculpture or tree doing the best job of making 4View really pop. But there are still a lot of issues. While in normal 2D mode, the Hydrogen One’s 5.7 4View display is relatively high-res at 2560 x 1440. But when you turn 3D on, you can immediately see that the screen’s resolution is significantly reduced to the point where you can see individual pixels. On top of that, nothing ever looks that sharp, and there’s always a faint rainbow color cast lurking in the background that makes things look more dreamy than real. But I might just be a little jaded, so to get a better sense of what others might think, check out our video to see fellow GMG staffers and their first experience with 4View (check out the video above).AdvertisementRed knows its 4View display alone wasn’t going to be enough to sell this phone because outside of other Hydrogen One owners sharing pics with each other via the Holopix app or a few other tools, there’s a limited bucket of 3D content to check out. The Hydrogen Network app offers 20 or so movie snippets that you can watch, while the Red Leia Loft app tacks on support for games like  but that’s about it. (Oh, AT&T is also giving people who buy a Hydrogen One from them free 4View versions of Ready Player One and Fantastic Beasts). So to help flesh out available 4View content, Red made sure that the Hydrogen One can not only show 3D, it can capture 3D too.Using the dual cameras in front and back, the Hydrogen can shoot both 3D stills and video, though there are limitations. For the front-facing cams, you can only shoot 3D in portrait orientation, which isn’t actually a big deal. But in back, you are limited to just landscape shots, which is more annoying. Some issues might stem from the tech still being early in its development cycle, such as 4View video recording turning off in the middle of a clip because the phone thinks it’s too bright outside. But even if you can ignore those problems, the Hydrogen’s One’s standard image quality doesn’t impress.AdvertisementIn almost ideal conditions at a well-lit bakery, the Hydrogen One’s camera produced a shot that looked dull, lifeless, and just generally worse than what I got from a Pixel 3. Next, when I shot a picture of some pumpkins, the Hydrogen One struggled with dynamic range, as seen in its blown-out highlights and underexposed details in the shadows. And at night, things got really bad, with the Hydrogen One producing seriously blurry and noisy images repeatedly in multiple locations. Even the phone’s camera app features an awkward UI. To capture 3D pics, you need to hit the 2D button to switch between shooting modes, and to switch into video mode, you need to hit the camera button. It doesn’t really make a lot of sense, and it’s definitely not intuitive. There’s also no option to show grid lines to help with composition, and while I do appreciate that Red included the ability to display a histogram, that might be the nicest thing I can say about the phone’s camera.I suppose that after seeing first-time phone makers like Essential and Razer struggle to nail image quality out of the gate, I shouldn’t be surprised. But given Red’s heritage, I was expecting a much better showing.AdvertisementTheoretically, all this could be solved through the Hydrogen One’s modular add-on system, which promises to someday let the phone connect to the company’s super expensive cameras, or attach a standalone sensor and third-party lenses from camera makers including Nikon, Canon, Sony, Leica, and others. But those mods don’t exist yet, and there’s no telling when they’ll arrive.Where things start to get truly ugly though is that for a phone that costs $1,300, its specs are outdated from day one. It’s got a Snapdragon 835 chip from last year, and while 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage are nice, it’s still running Android 8.1, and Red says Android 9 won’t arrive until sometime in 2019. (Currently, its security patch dates back to July, so hopefully, Red addresses that before it goes on sale November 2.) Its LCD display also isn’t very colorful and doesn’t sport the contrast ratios you’d get from a more modern OLED panel. Even the Hydrogen One’s massive 4,500 mAh hour battery is held back by inefficient components, because with a run time of 11:51, Red’s phone lasts an hour or two less than an iPhone XS Max (13:07) or a Galaxy Note 9 (14:11), and is only marginally better than a Pixel 3 XL (11:24).AdvertisementUltimately, the Hydrogen One is a very beefy handset with dated internals, no water-resistance or wireless charging, a splashy screen that’s only a bit better than a Nintendo 3DS, and overall image quality that puts Red’s own name to shame. If that doesn’t sound like a phone conjured up in an alternate reality, I don’t know what does. And while there’s still a chance Red can redeem the Hydrogen One and its tech in the future, it’s going to be a long time until a lot of people not named Jim Jannard will really want to own this phone.Android 8.1 • Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 • 6GB of RAM • 128GB of storage • microSD card slot • 2560 x 1440 5.7-inch LCD display • dual 8-MP front cams • dual 12-MP rear cams • Bluetooth 5.0 • USB-C • 3.5mm jack • 4,500 mAh battery 6.48 x 3.37 x 0.39 inches• 9.27 ounces• available from AT&T and Verizon • aluminum version comes in black and gray, titanium model coming soonAdvertisement', `date` = '10/29/18 8:00am', `ja_title` = 'レッド・ハイドロージェン・ワンは、代替のリアリティのための電話です', `ja_body` = 'ジム・ジャナードは興味深い人だ オートバイ部品を販売するワンマンビジネスを始めると、彼はゴーグルと眼鏡にピボットすることにした。 約25年前から、オークリーは世界最大のサングラスのブランドの一つになっていた。 その後、2007年にはオークリーを21億ドルで売却し、ジャナードは他の会社に転向し、同年には初の4Kの映画用デジタルカメラを出荷した。 両社はいずれの定義においても高い成功をおさめ、3番目のピボットのために、ジャナードは自分の考えをより高く設定し、市場の他のものとは違ってスマートフォンを作ると考えていた。 しかし、今回は、私は少し遠すぎたかもしれませんが、例えばRed Hydrogen Oneは、その野心的な3Dディスプレイを使っているのではなく、3Dディスプレイを使っている携帯電話のように感じます。これは、1,295ベリーのソリッド・ビルド、専用のカメラボタン、ヘッドホン、高価な、超高額なカメラ、モジュール性がまだ動作していない、というヘッドホンを使っている人たちが作った3Dスクリーンを使っている。 回転するアルミニウムのフレームとケブラーのパネル(近日のチタン・クラッド・モデル)から作られた革命的広告は、タンクのように見え、さらに重いものになっている。 背中や脇にチーズをおろすことができる溝を突き刺し、後ろには赤い玉が刻まれた赤いメディア・マシーンを刻んだ刻印された金属に囲まれています。 これらはすべて、一種の希薄な耐久性を実現するために組み合わされ、長い間初めて、安全な携帯電話が必要と感じられる電話をしていると感じます。 つまり、現代のガラスサンドイッチの完全なアンチテーゼではないが、ランナディッシュは止まらないが、データと充電のためのUSB-Cポートに加えて、Hydrogen Oneは(ガス)ヘッドフォンジャックとmicroSDカードトレーを備えているので、すぐにでもすぐに出てくる小さな裏切りのイジェクタのピンの1つに頼るのではなく、新しい携帯電話を手に入れることができる。 そして、その側面には、ボリュームの上下にボタンを追加するだけでなく、右側には指紋センサー付きのロックボタンと、Red.AdvertisementAllによる電話にぴったりのカメラ用のボタンがある。これは、ハイドロゲンのハイライト機能にはプリアンブルである。 では、4Viewスタンドは何を求めているのでしょうか。 私は完全には分からないしレッドのウェブサイトも正確にはそれを綴っていない しかし、4Viewが提供するということは、そこにはかなりのものがある。 4Viewは「世界初のホログラフィー画面」であると主張する赤の主張と、最もホットなブズワードを含むコンポーネントを含んでいる。 ナノテクノロジーを利用した独自のLightfield (ライトフィールド)の画面では、眼鏡を必要とせずにイマーシブ3D画像を提供する。 ( 4Viewが実際にどのように機能するのかを知りたい人については、ここでこの技術のクリエイターの一人とこのインタビューをチェックしてください。悲しいことに、これらのファンシーな言葉や深みのある深さは、通常の写真やビデオでは見られません。つまり、それは人間だけの経験を積んだものであることを意味します。 そして私にとってハイドロジェン1のディスプレイは新しいニンテンドー3DSに手を出すより少し改良されたバージョンなのです そして、メガネがなくても、画像は画面を飛び出し、空中に飛び出すように見えるが、私が期待していたのは革命的なディスプレイではない。私の意見では、私の意見では、この技術はビデオよりもよく見えるし、彫刻や木のような硬い線のようなものを、4Viewのようなものを実際にポップするのに最も良い仕事をしている写真を撮影したものだ。 しかし、まだ多くの問題が残っている。 通常の2Dモードでは、5.7 4Viewディスプレイは2560 x 1440の比較的高価である。 しかし、3Dをオンにすると、画面の解像度が、個々のピクセルを表示できる点まで著しく減少することがわかります。 その上、その鋭いものは何も見えないし、背景には、現実よりも夢のようなものを作るかすかな虹のキャスティングが常に存在する。 しかし、他のHydrogen OneのオーナーがHolopixのアプリやその他のいくつかのツールを使ってpicsを共有しているために、3Dコンテンツのチェックにバケツが制限されているので、広告主のディスプレイだけではこの電話を売ることができないという。 Hydrogen Networkのアプリは、視聴者が視聴できる映画スニペット20またはそれを提供しているが、Red Leia Loftのアプリはゲームをサポートするが、それはそれについてのものだ。 (おお、AT&Tはまた、無料の4ViewバージョンのReady Player OneとFantastic BeastからHydrogen Oneを購入する人々にも提供している)。 Redは、4Viewのコンテンツを削除するために、Hydrogen Oneが3Dを表示できるだけでなく、3Dもキャプチャできることを確認しました。前と背中の二重カメラを使って、Hydrogenは3Dのスティールとビデオの両方を撮影することができますが、制限があります。 正面のカメラでは、3Dで撮影できるのは縦長のみで、実際には大きな取引ではありません。 しかし、裏では風景の写真だけに制限されているので、それには苛性がある。 一部の問題は、4Viewのビデオ記録がクリップの真ん中でオフになっているという点で、まだ初期段階にある技術に起因するものもあるかもしれない。なぜなら、スマートフォンは外があまりにも明るいという理由だ。 しかし、それらの問題を無視できるとしても、水素の標準的なイメージの質は、インプレッジメントにはほとんど理想的ではありません。広告主のカメラは、よく照らされたパン屋で、ほとんど理想的な条件を持っていますが、これは、Pixel 3で得たものよりも、鈍い、活気のない、そして、一般的に、より悪い写真を撮影したものです。 次に、いくつかのカボチャの写真を撮ると、ハイドロジェン・ワンはダイナミックレンジで奮闘し、その吹き飛んだハイライトに見られるようになり、影の中の詳細を暴露した。 そして夜にはとても悪いものになり水素は重々しげな雑音を繰り返します色んな場所で繰り返します 電話のカメラアプリでさえ、ぎこぎないUIが機能している。 3D picsをキャプチャするには、[ 2D ]ボタンを押して、撮影モード間を切り替え、ビデオモードに切り替える必要があります。カメラボタンを押す必要があります。 あまり意味がないわけではありませんまったく直感的なものではありません 構成を助けるための格子線を示すオプションもなく、赤にはヒストグラムを表示する能力が含まれているが、電話のカメラカットについて言えることがあるかもしれない。例えばEssentialの電話機メーカーとレイザーが、ゲートから画像の質を釘で打つのに苦労しているのを見た後、驚いてはならないと思う。 しかし、レッドの遺産を考えると、私はより良い広告を期待していた。広告主は、同社の超高価なカメラに電話を接続するか、あるいはニコン、キノン、ソニー、ライカなどのカメラメーカーから独立したセンサーとサードパーティのレンズを接続することを約束する、水素のモジュラー・アドバンドシステムによって解決されることができる。 しかし、それらはまだ存在していないし、いつ到着するかわからない。どこから本当に醜いのかというと、1300ドルの携帯電話の場合、その仕様は1日1日付から外されている。 昨年からSnapdragon 835チップが搭載され、RAM 6GBと128GBのストレージは良いが、まだAndroid 8.1を実行しており、Redは2019年にAndroid 9をリリースしないことを発表している。 (現在のセキュリティパッチは7月に遡るので、レッドアドレスは11月2日に発売される前に発売されている。また、LCDディスプレイも色鮮度ではなく、より現代のOLEDパネルから得られるコントラスト比を高くはない。 HD−Oneの巨大な4,500 mAhのバッテリーは非効率的なコンポーネントで保持されているが、赤色の携帯電話はiPhone XS Max (13:07)またはGalaxy Note 9 (14:11)よりも1時間も2時間も短く、かつ、Hydrogen Oneは時代遅れのインターナル、耐水抵抗や無線充電のない携帯電話、Nintendo 3DSよりも少しだけ良いスプラシィ画面、そして全体的なイメージの質を備えたものだ。 赤の自分の名前は恥ずべきものだ 電話が交互の現実に響くような音がしなければ、私は何をするのかわからない。 そして、今でもRedがHydrogen Oneとその技術を再利用する可能性はまだあるものの、多くの人がこの電話を所有したいと思うだろう。Android 8.1 Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 6GB RAM 128GB RAM 128GB RAM 128GB RAM 128GB RAM 128GB内蔵microSDカードスロット2560 × 1440 5.70インチLCDディスプレイデュアル12-MP背面カメラにはBluetooth 5.0 USB-C 3.5mm充電式バッテリー6.48 × 3.37 × 0.39インチ、AT&TとVerizonから利用可能か アルミニウムのバージョンは黒と灰色で、チタン製のモデルはソーン広告に来る', `updated_at` = '2018-10-29 12:01:40' WHERE `articles`.`id` = 1[0m

The photo went viral on Facebook, Twitter, and dozens of news sites. But we’ve got some bad news for you, or good news depending on how you look at it. The photo is totally fake.AdvertisementThe viral photo was actually staged by a group of YouTubers known as The Yes Theory using a Justin Bieber lookalike. The pranksters first planned a fake video of the Bieber impersonator helping an old woman across the street, but that one failed to go viral. They had better luck with their idea of Bieber eating a burrito like a weirdo.Yesterday, the pranksters finally published a YouTube video explaining how they did it, and it wasn’t a small enterprise. They actually flew a Justin Bieber lookalike from Canada to Los Angeles and meticulously studied the real Bieber’s look. They made sure that the fake Bieber was wearing long pants and a sweatshirt because the real Bieber has quite a few tattoos. They even bought a wig to make the fake Bieber’s hair look closer to the real thing.AdvertisementThe explainer video is actually an interesting look at how to stage a viral prank. The pranksters tried to post the burrito photo to Reddit but were thwarted by the fact that they tried to post it on r/Pics, a huge community, and nobody noticed. But when they posted the image to a smaller sub, r/MildlyInfuriating, the photo finally made waves.Paper magazine was one of the first mainstream publications to write about the photo and from there it spread everywhere from Cosmopolitan to Vanity Fair. It even reached highly respected mainstream news outlets like the BBC and plenty of morning news TV shows commented on Bieber’s burrito-eating techniques. The internet helped it spread, but this photo was basically made for light-hearted TV news shows.The pranksters talked to a number of different news outlets and kept up the charade by pretending that they just happened to capture the image in a West Hollywood park. So it’s not like this was a simple misunderstanding. They deliberately set out to prank the internet and succeeded beyond their wildest expectations.AdvertisementBut just as quickly as the photo went viral, it’s also being debunked with incredible speed.

Adenoviruses are a family of common viruses that can cause respiratory symptoms as well as diarrhea, fever, internal inflammation, and neurological disease, among others. The outbreak at Wanaque is type 7 adenovirus, which the Centers for Disease Control writes is “most commonly associated with acute respiratory disease.” Usually adenovirus infections are mild, but they can quickly become life-threatening if a patient is immunocompromised or has respiratory difficulties, and those patients can remain infectious for quite some time.AdvertisementCNN wrote that while eight of the deaths have all been confirmed to be the result of adenovirus infections, health officials still awaiting laboratory confirmation of a ninth:The ninth victim, described as “medically fragile with respiratory illness” by the Wanaque Center for Nursing and Rehabilitation in Haskell, died late Saturday night at a hospital, the state health department said in a statement. It is awaiting laboratory confirmation of adenoviruses in a child who died Friday.The viruses are known to persist on unclean surfaces and medical instruments, and may not be eliminated by common disinfectants, but they rarely cause severe illness in healthy people. Those with weakened immune systems, though, have a higher risk for severe disease and may remain infectious long after they recover, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says. They are common in places with large groups of children, such as child-care settings, schools and summer camps.AdvertisementDr. Shereef Elnahal, the state health commissioner, previously told USA Today that the sick children had compromised immune systems and were reliant on breathing machines, and that the facility could not quarantine them outside its ventilator unit.“There was not a place (at the center) where they could have been safely placed,” Elnahal said.As CNN noted, the facility says it promptly notified the New Jersey Department of Health (NJDOH) and other relevant agencies upon identifying the virus, and the NJDOH said the Wanaque facility is in “full compliance” with an order barring new admissions of patients. However, the union representing the facility’s nurses, Health Professionals and Allied Employees (HPAE), issued a statement saying that staff “reported a shortage of nursing staff which may lead to poor infection control practices that can put patient safety at risk.” Investigators found “minor hand-washing deficiencies,” CNN wrote, and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services gave it an above-average quality rating but below-average hygiene rating based on an investigation in August.AdvertisementVanderbilt University infectious disease specialist Dr. William Schaffner told CNN earlier this year that while adenoviruses are hard to diagnose and infections are believed to be under-reported, “They cause principally a whole bunch of minor troublesome infections spread by children, often from children to adults. But they’re not nearly as serious as influenza.”“This is a tragic situation, and our thoughts are with the families who are grieving right now,” Elnahal said in a statement on the NJDOH website. “We are working every day to ensure all infection control protocols are continuously followed and closely monitoring the situation at the facility.”[CNN]Advertisement', `date` = '10/28/18 8:05pm', `ja_title` = 'ニュージャージー・ナッシング・ホーム・フェイシング・アデノウイルス・アウトブレイクにおける第9子の日', `ja_body` = 'CNNによると、9月26日から10月22日にかけて、ハスケル市内の看護とリハビリのために、少なくとも25人の小児科アデノウイルス感染が確認されている。 アデノウイルスは、下痢、発熱、内部炎症、神経疾患などの呼吸器疾患を引き起こす可能性がある一般的なウイルスの一つである。 ワナークでの流行は7型アデノウイルスで、疾病管理センターは「急性呼吸器疾患に最もよく関連している」とされている。「通常アデノウイルスの感染症は温和だが、患者が免疫不全か、呼吸困難がある場合には、すぐに命を脅かす可能性があります。広告CNNは、8人の死亡者が、アデノウイルス感染の結果と確認されているものの、9番目の被害者は9番目の確認を待っていると確認しました。9番目の被害者は、ワナークセンターによって「呼吸器病患者」として記載されている9番目の被害者のことです。 保健当局によると、ハスケルで看護とリハビリテーションが10日夜、病院で死亡した。 このウイルスは、不浄の表面や医療器具に固執することで知られており、一般的な消毒薬によっては除去されないかもしれないが、健康な人に重病をもたらすことはほとんどない。 しかしアメリカ疾病予防管理センター( CDC )によると、免疫システムが弱体化すると、重症疾患のリスクが高く、回復後も感染が続く可能性があると、米国疾病対策センター(CDC)は発表した これらは、保育設定、学校、夏のキャンプなど、子供の大きなグループのある場所で一般的に行われています。 ステート・コミッショナーのシェールフ・エルナハル氏は以前、USAトゥデイに対し、病気の子供たちは免疫系を危険にさらされており、呼吸器に依存しており、施設は換気装置の外で隔離することはできないと述べていた。エルナハル容疑者は「(中央に)無事配置された場所はありませんでした」というエルナハルさんの説明によると、この施設ではニュージャージー州保健省( NJDOH)などの関連機関に対し、ウイルスを特定するよう即座に通知したという。NJDOHによると、Wanークの施設は患者の新たな出所を阻もうとする命令で「完全なコンプライアンス」を受けているとNJDOHは説明している。 しかし、同施設の看護師、保健専門家、アライド・プロフェッショナル( HPAE)を代表する労働組合は、「職員が看護スタッフ不足を報告し、患者の安全を危険にさらすことができる、病弱者の感染管理の慣行を悪化させる可能性がある」としている。「調査員は、「軽微な手洗いの欠陥」を発見しました。また、メディアセンターとメディケイド・サービシズのセンターでは、高品質の格付けを提供していましたが、アウグスト・アドバ・ヴァンダービルト大学の感染症専門家であるウィリアム・シャフナー博士が、CNNに対して、アデノウイルスは診断と感染が報告されていないとの考えを早期に報告しているとし、「これらの原因は、主に小さな厄介な疾患の多くを引き起こしている」と指摘した。 子供たちや子供から大人にも広がります エルナハル氏はNJDOHのウェブサイトに掲載された声明で、「これは悲劇的な状況であり、私たちの考えは今、悲嘆にくれている家族との間にある」と述べた。 「私たちは毎日、すべての感染制御プロトコルを継続的に追跡し、施設の状況を注意深く監視していることを確認している」[CNN]', `updated_at` = '2018-10-29 12:02:03' WHERE `articles`.`id` = 5[0m

Bangalter, the robot with the horizontal Cyclops-style visor, has recently done some solo work for soundtracks—most recently in Gaspar Noé’s Climax—but this particular track was especially rare given the obscurity of the Latvian film and the fact that musician David Guetta seemed to have somehow procured the only copy in existence (according to Your EDM).Now, thankfully, a Daft Punk fan has uploaded the entire 14-minute track to YouTube, meaning even those of us who are not David Guetta can still enjoy it. “Riga (Take 5),” which you can hear below, is a bit of a slow burn, but things do eventually kick off in a cool, Daft Punk-y way after a while. There are no robot voices, arguably the best part of any Daft Punk song, but maybe that’s because this is meant to be from Thomas Bangalter the “human” and not Thomas Bangalter the techno robot.

One joke that got cut from the film goes pretty far into nastier territory—but it’s so funny that the director regrets letting it go. In an interesting interview for the Hollywood Reporter reflecting on the 25th anniversary of the film, Selick reveals the circumstances behind cutting one of the film’s most infamous almost-gags.Advertisement“There’s a shot — and I really regret replacing it — at the very end of the film when Jack comes back and then Sandy Claws flies overhead and there’s snow and Christmas comes to Halloween Town. We show a lot of Halloween Towners enjoying winter sports and snow and you see the vampires playing hockey and they hit the puck right at the camera — and originally it was Tim Burton’s head,” says Selick.Unfortunately, the shot got cut, but Selick thinks it was probably not necessary.“And it was really funny. And Denise Di Novi or one of the Hollywood producers told me, ‘I don’t think Tim’s going to like that.’ And I feel so stupid for not just asking him. But that’s one of the shots that we reshot and we put in a pumpkin instead. I don’t know if that shot still exists, but I’d love to replace the one in there and I’m sure Tim would love it,” Selick continues.AdvertisementThere’s an irony in that: cutting a gruesome gag because one of the most self-conscious lover of all things spooky in films might have possibly been offended. If that shot still exists, they should restore it. For Tim, and for everyone. Though, uh, maybe not for the kids who probably watch this movie. Sorry, kids.

He’s a clown, which, scary enough, but he can move his body in ways that seem, ah, unnatural.

None of it is CG. Pretzel Jack’s contortions and bizarre behavior are entirely the performance of Troy James.”Talent can compete pretty strongly with on-screen magic, apparently. “Basically, on set, the script would say, ‘He does a bizarre contortionist dance,’ and Troy would say, ‘Well, I’m going to try this,’ or ‘I’m going to try that,’ and he would do these incredible twisting things with his body. We’d all be standing there going, ‘Oh my God!’ There’s a whole bunch on the cutting room floor, because we couldn’t use all of it, of just him doing these crazy pretzel contortions with himself. I have to assure everybody that it’s not CGI because there are moments when his behavior is so bonkers, you’d think a person couldn’t really do that — but he did.

But there were a few obvious areas for improvement, and Anker tackled all of the big ones with the brand new Capsule II, now up for preorder on Kickstarter.Anker’s new Nebula entertainment brand officially launched its second portable projector this year…So what’s new?1) Resolution: The original Capsule’s standard definition 480p has been bumped to 720p, so your videos should look a lot crisper. Easy win.Advertisement2) Brightness: The first Capsule’s 100 ANSI lumen bulb was fine in a dark room, but the Capsule II’s is twice as bright, which means you’ll be able to get a usable picture in more lighting conditions, and at larger screen sizes. I saw it firsthand in a fairly well-lit event space, and while not as bright as a TV screen or a full-sized projector, it was definitely bright enough to watch a movie.3) Software: The original Capsule had a version of Android installed, but it was pretty janky, and didn’t have access to Google Play. This time around, the Capsule II ships with Android TV 9.0 onboard, with access to the vast Google Play app store, which means you won’t have to rely on your phone for casting content.There are a few other minor differences of note, including the inclusion of USB-C Power Delivery for fast charging, an improved speaker, and autofocus. It is a bit bigger than the Capsule (which will remain on sale for the time being); Anker calls it “pint sized,” rather than soda can-sized, which was pretty cheeky of them. Whatever beverage you compare it to though, it’s still very small for a projector.AdvertisementKickstarter backers can preorder the Capsule II right now for $399.

The backlash has reportedly continued to mount throughout the weekend, with Gab’s hosting provider Joyent notifying the site’s management its account will be suspended as of 9:00 a.m. ET on Oct. 29, and payment processor Stripe suspending transfers to Gab’s bank account “effective immediately.”Per the Verge, Gab’s Twitter account posted one alleged message from Joyent advising them of “notice of a breach of the Joyent terms of service” and another from Stripe saying Gab had “not provided us sufficient evidence that Gab actually prevents violations of our policies in your Gab Pro service, or any other portion of your service that relies on Stripe for monetization.” (Stripe was already looking into Gab before the shootings, imposing a freeze on Gab’s account in early October and asking the site to ensure that it imposes policies prohibiting “adult or illegal content.”) The alleged message from Stripe said its investigation would take about a week to complete and it was “suspending transfers to your bank account, effective immediately.”AdvertisementNeither company responded to a request for comment from the New York Times, nor did Joyent immediately respond to a request for comment from Gizmodo on Sunday. A Stripe spokesperson told Gizmodo the company did not comment on individual accounts “for privacy reasons,” though referred us to the company’s list of prohibited businesses.According to the Verge, a Microsoft spokesperson said its Azure contract with Gab was terminated last month. The Washington Post reported that Gab’s chief technology officer, Ekrem Büyükkaya, announced he was stepping down on Sunday because “attacks from the American press have been relentless for two years now and have taken a toll on me personally.” Gab has also tweeted it would likely be banned from both Facebook and Twitter, though both accounts remained active as of Sunday afternoon.Archived versions of a Gab account matching Bowers’ name were full of posts containing screeds against Jews, spreading a baseless smear that a “kike infestation” controls the highest levels of government, and targeting the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society (HIAS) for particular scorn and thinly-veiled threats. Before the mass shooting on Saturday, in which Bowers was captured alive after a gun battle with responding police and tactical teams, the user behind the account posted: HIAS likes to bring invaders in that kill our people. I can’t sit by and watch my people get slaughtered. Screw your optics, I’m going in.Advertisement Michael Edison Hayden, an open source intelligence analyst at Storyful who specializes in extremism and disinformation, told Gizmodo that Gab was rife with similar content, and other users on the site were already rallying in support of Bowers with the hashtag #HeroRobertBowers.“Andrew Torba, the CEO of Gab, will get angry when people for call his site a white nationalist website or an alt-right website but anyone who spends time on it knows that it’s a haven for extremists,” Hayden wrote. “Violent white supremacist groups like Patriot Front and Atomwaffen Division organize out in the open on Gab.

But the same day, it did email users the same statement it previously posted to Medium asserting it does not support violence, complies with the law, and is working with authorities to provide access to Bowers’ alleged account. The statement also hinted that if unspecified individuals were denied “free speech,” they will express their views “through violence.” Gab also retweeted an account claiming Gizmodo’s prior coverage was “disingenuous.”Elsewhere, Gab tweeted it had secured a new hosting service to replace Joyent, though Torba also posted on Gab that “We will build everything from the ground up if we have to. We may be down for a few weeks. The truth is we do not know yet.” It is unclear what replacement they will be able to obtain for payment processing services, if any. In what Gab tweeted was its response to interview questions from the Times, it wrote, “Bitcoin is the future and the future is here.”Advertisement[The Verge]Update 10/28/18 11:22pm EST — GoDaddy is no longer the registrar for the Gab.com domain.

He comes off as a crazed & stumbling lunatic who should be running out of money pretty soon,” Trump tweeted. “As bad as their field is, if he is running for President, the Dems will eat him alive!”AdvertisementSteyer, who has for months advocated for Trump’s impeachment, was one of Sayoc Jr.’s alleged targets this week. On Friday, a suspicious package addressed to Steyer was intercepted in California, CNN reported. Authorities believe it was sent by Sayoc Jr. It is unclear from reports whether or not the package had a bomb.“We’re thankful that everyone we work with is safe. We are seeing a systematic attack on our democracy that extends much further than just one isolated terrorist in Florida. That’s why we are running an impeachment petition to end the culture of lawlessness in our country,” Steyer tweeted on Friday.On State of the Union, Tapper asked Steyer about a tweet that House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy posted on Tuesday, after a mail bomb was sent to billionaire Democratic philanthropist George Soros. In the tweet, which McCarthy had pinned to his Twitter account before he eventually deleted it, the Republican congressman said, “We cannot allow Soros, Steyer, and [Michael] Bloomberg to BUY this election!”AdvertisementTapper pointed out that Soros and Bloomberg are Jewish, along with Steyer’s late father.“That seems to me like a straight-up anti-Semitic move,” Steyer told Tapper.Steyer rejected the notion that there is “loud language on both sides,” because “what we’re seeing is terrible behavior, consistent, systematic political violence from Republicans, and when people stand up to it, then they describe that as ‘strong language on both sides.’”AdvertisementThe “both sides” argument was part of a statement issued by McCarthy’s communications director, Matt Sparks, in the wake of public condemnation of the congressman’s tweet.“Understanding the particular sensitivity of the past 24 hours in the political climate today that has led to specific threats on both sides of the aisle, we will redouble our focus on our agenda of results,” Sparks said, according to CNN.Responding to Trump’s tweet on Sunday, Steyer wrote, “@realdonaldtrump just tweeted at me in his typical insulting style after watching @CNNsotu. It is unthinkable that in the midst of the horrible political violence our president would resort to name-calling instead of repairing the damage to the fabric of our country.”AdvertisementTapper responded by tweeting, “Thanks for watching CNN, Mr. President!”', `date` = '10/28/18 3:43pm', `ja_title` = 'トランプ・アタック、もう一人の犠牲者を攻撃\nメイル・ボム・サスペクト・セザオック・ジュニア', `ja_body` = '反ユダヤ人テロ犯のロバート・バワーズ氏が、ピッツバーグのシナゴーグで11人を殺害し、トランプ氏にパイプ爆弾を流すために逮捕された翌日の1日、トランプ氏は犠牲者を攻撃するためにパイプ爆弾を流しているという。「私が前に行動していない、ワッキー・トム・スタイヤーが@jaketapperのインタビューを受けるのを見ただけだ。 トランプ氏は、トランプ氏がツイッターで「狂気の狂った狂人として、すぐにお金を使い切ることができる」とツイートした。 「彼が大統領のために走っているなら、その歌は彼を生きたまま食べることになる。「トランプ氏の弾劾を支持するために数カ月を支持する広告主は、今週サオク・ジュニアの標的とされた人物の一人だった。 CNNの報道によると、カリフォルニア州では、スティーヤーへの不審物の傍受が傍受された。 当局は、このパッケージに爆弾があったのかどうかは不明だが、サイオク・ジュニアによって送られたと考えている。「私たちは、一緒に働いているすべての人が安全であることを感謝しています。 私たちは、フロリダにある孤立したテロリストよりもずっと続く、我々の民主主義に対する組織的な攻撃を見ている。 トランプ氏はツイッターで、「私たちの国では無法の文化を終わらせるために、弾劾請願を実行している」とツイートした。 これを削除する前に、マッカーシーが自身のツイッターアカウントにピン留めしていたツイートで、共和党の下院議員は、「ソロスとシュタイヤー、そしてマイケル・ブルームバーグ氏が今回の選挙に出馬することを許せない。「広告主タッパーは、ソロスとブルームバーグがユダヤ人で、スティーヤの亡父と一緒にいることを指摘した。「私には、反ユダヤ人の動きがはっきりしているようだ」と、スティーヤーはTapper.Steyerに対し、「両サイドに大きな言語があるようだ」と断言した。なぜなら、「私たちが見ているのは、共和党との間で一貫した、組織的な政治的暴力、そして人々が立ち上がっているときに、両者は「強い言葉」だということだ。 下院議員のツイート。「今日の政治風土における過去24時間の特定の感度を理解することで、両サイドにおける特定の脅威につながった」と、トランプ氏のツイートによると、「@realdonaldtrumpは@CNNsotuを見た後、典型的な侮辱的なスタイルで私をツイートしたばかりだ。 恐ろしい政治的暴力のさなかに、私たちの大統領が国の布地への被害を修復するのではなく、名電話をかけることも考えられない。\" AdvertisementTapperはツイートで応えた\"、「CNNを見てくれてありがとうございます大統領!。', `updated_at` = '2018-10-29 12:02:46' WHERE `articles`.`id` = 12[0m

Campbell’s vice president of government affairs Kelly Johnston tweeted Monday that Soros’ Open Society Foundations was providing aid to a migrant caravan currently making its way to the Mexican border, a claim Open Society says is baseless.Tweeting from an account that’s no longer active, Johnston claimed that Soros’ organization was the puppet master behind “troop carriers” and “rail cars taking [the migrants] north.” Without any apparent evidence for his claims, Johnston also tweeted that Open Society “planned and is executing this, including where they defecate.” The since-deleted tweet was shared by the New York Times’ Kenneth Vogel.AdvertisementThe company told CNN last week that Johnston’s remarks on Twitter did not reflect the position of the company. A spokesperson for Campbell’s told Gizmodo in a statement by email that Johnston’s last day with the company was Thursday.“Mr. Johnston and the company discussed in August that he would transition out of his role with his departure scheduled for early November,” the spokesperson said. “In the last few days, the company and Mr. Johnston agreed that under the current circumstances it would be best to accelerate the timing of his departure.”AdvertisementResponding to Johnston’s remarks in a tweet on Tuesday, Open Society said that “neither Mr. Soros nor Open Society is funding this effort,” adding that it does, however, “support the historic U.S. commitment to welcoming people fleeing oppression and violence in their homelands.”Soros was among the individuals targeted this week in a series of attempted bombings aimed at more than a dozen prominent Democrats and critics of President Donald Trump, including the Obamas, the Clintons, Senator Cory Booker, and CNN’s New York bureau, among others. A homemade pipe bomb was found in a mailbox at Soros’ New York home, though he was not home at the time of the incident.AdvertisementSoros, a political activist and prominent donor to the Democratic party, is a frequent target of conservative groups. In addition to conspiracy theories about Soros’ philanthropy and activism, he is also the target of anti-Semitic rhetoric and has been accused of funding protests and riots. Earlier this month, President Donald Trump appeared throw fuel on the fire of the anti-Soros conspiracy onslaught by accusing the billionaire on Twitter of paying protesters.As the Washington Post noted, Johnston’s tweets last week were not the only ones alleging a connection between Soros’ organization and the migrant caravan or other events.

The company said in a microblog post after nominal first and second stages that the spacecraft failed to reach orbit as a result of an issue with the third stage.The company said that “cowling separation was normal but something abnormal happened after the second stage.” The statement on its Weibo social media account did not elaborate.AdvertisementAccording to SpaceNews, the Zhuque-1 rocket cost approximately $14 million to develop and was approximately 62 feet (19 meters) tall, with a weight of just short of 30 U.S. tons. It was developed as part of a Chinese private spaceflight push that has been ongoing for years, with at least 10 domestic companies vying to enter the marker. Rival OneSpace test-fired fourth-stage engines for its OS-M rocket earlier this month, SpaceNews wrote, and is planning on launching a payload to orbit by the end of this year after becoming the first private Chinese company to launch a rocket to space in May 2018. “Reliability is only built up over time, and therefore launch cadence and experience will have to be acquired before reliability can be truly assessed for Landspace or any other launch company,” Ohio State University aerospace expert John Horack told SpaceNews. “One should expect failures, as this is not an easy business. SpaceX, Orbital, Virgin, and others have all dealt with this.... early failures can sink a company almost before they start.”SpaceNews added that it is unclear whether the failure of Saturday’s launch spells doom for Landspace’s more grandiose ambitions, which have included a much larger Zhuque-2 model:The two-stage Zhuque-2 (ZQ-2), which Landspace aims to manufacture next year and launch for the first time in 2020, will measure 48.8-meters tall with a diameter of 3.35 meters and be capable of delivering a 4,000-kilogram payload capacity to a 200-kilometer low Earth orbit and 2,000 kilograms to 500-kilometer SSO, using 80-ton and 10-ton methalox engines.,,, Landspace had announced plans to further, larger Zhuque-2 series three-stage rockets—using variable thrust engines to allow attempting vertical landings and reuse of first stages—capable of carrying up to 32,000 kilograms to 200-kilometer low Earth orbit.Advertisement(For comparison, those plans for the advanced Zhuque-2 model would have a payload capacity somewhere between SpaceX’s Falcon 9 and the Falcon Heavy, which is really quite a high bar.)While this was a setback for Landspace, it wasn’t as dramatic a failure as Interstellar Technologies’ attempt to be the first Japanese company to launch a rocket into space in late June, when its MOMO-2 rocket barely got off the launch pad before falling back down and exploding.[The Guardian/SpaceNews]Advertisement', `date` = '10/28/18 1:45pm', `ja_title` = '中国初の人工衛星打ち上げロケット「Into Orbit Suffers」の未指定打ち上げ失敗', `ja_body` = '土曜に人工衛星を地球周回軌道に打ち上げるための最初の民間ロケットとなる航空宇宙船「Zhuque-1」の3段目は、どこが間違っていたかは明らかになっていないが、今回の事故の映像は、中国中央テレビの運用に使われる予定だった「未来」と呼ばれる衛星が、実際には到達する可能性があまりないということを明らかにしている。 orbit.AdvertisementAdvertisementthe Guardianは、この失敗の性質については、その性質については詳述していないと記している。3段ロケットのZhuque-1は、北京に本拠を置く地形によって開発された。 同社はマイクロブログの投稿で、第1段階と第2段階では、第3段階の問題で軌道に到達できなかったとし、「分離は正常だったが、第2段階では異常なことが起きた」としている。「ウェイボーのソーシャルメディアアカウントに関する声明では、Zhuque-1ロケットは開発に約1400万ドルの費用がかかり、高さは約62フィート(19メートル)であり、重量はわずか30米ドルにすぎなかった。 トン。 これは中国の民間宇宙飛行の推進の一環として開発され、少なくとも10社が参加するために、国内企業が参加している。 SpaceNewsによると、Rival OneSpaceは今月初めにOS-Mロケットのための第4段階エンジンを試験発射し、2018年5月に宇宙にロケットを打ち上げる初の民間企業となった後に、今年末までにペイロードを軌道に乗せる計画を立てている。 オハイオ州立大学の航空宇宙専門家John HorackはSpaceNewsに対し、「信頼性は時間とともに構築されているだけであり、そのために、宇宙開発や経験を獲得するためには、信頼性を真に評価できるようになる必要がある」と語った。 「これは簡単な事業ではないので、失敗を期待すべきだ。 SpaceX、Orbital、Virgin、その他はすべてこの問題に対処している。 初期の失敗は、会社が出発する直前に流すことができる。「スペースメディアは、来年に生産を目指して2020年に地上空間を開発するZhuque-2 (ZQ-2)が、直径3.35メートルの高さ48.8メートルの高さ48.8メートルの高さ48.8メートルの高さを測定し、200kmの低軌道に2000kmのペイロードを、約2,000キログラムのペイロードを、80トンを使用して、2,000キログラムのSSOを実現することができるかどうかは不明としています。 10トンのメタロックスエンギネザー、ランドスペースはさらに大型のZhuque-2シリーズの3段ロケットを、垂直着陸を試み、32,000キログラムまでを200キロメートルの低地に再利用することを可能にする計画を発表していた(比較すると、高度なZhuque-2モデルの計画は、SpaceXのFalcon 9とファルコン重の間のどこかにペイロード容量がある。これは、ランドスペースにとっては後退したものの、6月末にMOMO-2ロケットが発射台から打ち上げられ、倒れ、爆発する前にロケットを打ち上げられる初の日本企業としては、「インターステラー・テクノロジーズ」がロケットを宇宙に打ち上げることを試みたのは、劇的な失敗ではなかった。[ガーディアン/スペースニュース]広告', `updated_at` = '2018-10-29 12:03:20' WHERE `articles`.`id` = 17[0m

The social media platform is now apologizing despite previously having told the user, Rochelle Ritchie, that the tweets did not violate its rules.Ritchie tweeted screengrabs on Friday of threatening tweets from the account @hardrock2016 as well as Twitter’s response to her complaint. In a series of tweets from the Twitter Safety account posted later that evening, the company said it “made a mistake when Rochelle Ritchie first alerted us to the threat made against her.” The tweets associated with the account @hardrock2016 have since been removed, and the company said it is “investigating what happened and will continue to work to improve how we handle concerns raised” by users on its platform.AdvertisementSayoc, a 56-year-old Floridian, was arrested this week in connection to the apparent explosive devices. The former pizza deliveryman and strip-club DJ was charged with sending 13 homemade pipe bombs to prominent critics of President Donald Trump, including former President Barack Obama, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, billionaire George Soros, Senator Cory Booker, and CNN’s New York bureau, among others.A sweep of archived tweets from the account that appears to be associated with Sayoc depicts a far-right ideology also evidenced by prominently displayed pro-Trump propaganda stickers on Sayoc’s van, some of which included Trump standing on a tank holding a machine gun, Trump critics in crosshairs, and a “drain the swamp sticker.” The Twitter account had previously sent threatening messages or far-right political memes to Eric Holder, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, former Vice President Joe Biden, and others.AdvertisementA 14th package addressed to billionaire and Democratic donor Tom Steyer was intercepted Friday in California. Steyer was also among the individuals targeted by Sayoc’s apparent Twitter account.Twitter isn’t the only social media platform flip-flopping on its abuse policy this week in the wake of the attempted bombings. Instagram also walked back its decision about its initial refusal to pull a post in which former Breitbart tech editor Milo Yiannopoulos seemingly praised the apparent pipe bombs and said he was “sad” the Daily Beast hadn’t received one. As was evidently the case with Twitter, it was only after widespread criticism and media coverage of its failure to pull the content that Instagram moved to action. The company’s spokeswoman Stephanie Noon later told the Daily Beast in a statement that Instagram “prohibit[s] celebration or praise of crimes committed, and we will remove content praising a bombing attempt as soon as we’re aware.”Following a request for comment from Twitter about its failure to suspend the account @hardrock2016, the Verge said the company pointed to blog posts from May and September that outlined its procedure for reviewing abusive behavior on its platform. But considering that Twitter is now having to apologize—again—for failing to do anything about the pervasive culture of vitriol and hate on its platform, it’s probably time to once again re-evaluate its system.Advertisement[The Verge, Twitter]', `date` = '10/28/18 12:45pm', `ja_title` = 'Twitterは、シーザー・サヨックによって送られた5月のツイートを削除するための失敗についてのコメントを発表した。', `ja_body` = '複数の有力民主党員やCNNに爆発物を送出した罪で起訴されたCesar Sayoc Jrに所属するツイッターアカウントは、サイト上での脅迫行動の歴史を持っており、少なくとも1人のTwitterユーザーがこれまでに報道したことがある。 ソーシャルメディアのプラットフォームは今、ユーザーのロシェル・リッチー( Rochelleリッチー)に違反していないと謝罪しているが、リッチーは金曜日にアカウント@hardrock2016のツイートをツイートしただけでなく、抗議に対するTwitterの反応もツイートしている。 夜遅くに投稿されたツイッターの安全アカウントからの一連のツイートで、同社は「ロシェル・リッチーが最初に彼女に対する脅迫について警告したときに、間違いを犯した」と発表した。「アカウント@hardrock2016に関連したツイートは削除されており、同社は「何が起きたかを調査している」と言っており、プラリディアンのユーザーが今週、明らかに爆発物と関連して逮捕されたことについて、フラリディア号のユーザーからの懸念を改善するために今後も努力を続けていくとしている。 元ピザの配達人とストライプ・クラブのDJは、ドナルド・トランプ大統領の著名人に13人の自家製パイプ爆弾を流し、その中には、ヒラリー・クリントン前国務長官、億万長者のジョージ・ソロス氏、上院議員コリー・ブッカー氏、CNNのニューヨーク支局などの著名人に13本の自家製パイプ爆弾を流したとされている。 トランプ氏は、トランプ氏が機関銃を保有している戦車に立ち、トランプ氏は十字線で批判し、「沼のステッカーを排水する」などと批判した。「ツイッターのアカウントは以前、エリック・ホルダー、上院民主党のチャック・シューマー上院院内総務、ジョー・バイデン前副大統領、さらにはothers.AdvertimentAの14番目のパッケージに対する脅迫メッセージや極右的な政治的ミームを、カリフォルニア州ではトム・スタイヤーが傍受した。 また、セイオクのツイッターアカウントが標的にされた個人の中にも、ツイッターが今週の爆破事件をきっかけに、ソーシャルメディア上で唯一の問題となっているのは、ソーシャルメディアのプラットフォームに過ぎない。 インスタグラムはまた、ブライトバートの元技術者であるMilo Yiannopoulosが、明らかなパイプ爆弾を称賛し、「悲しい」と言ったポストを拒否するという当初の拒否についても、インスタグラムはその決定を発表した。 Twitterで明らかになったように、インスタグラムが行動に移したコンテンツを引き出すことができなかったという批判とメディアの報道が広まったのは、明らかになってからだ。 同社の広報担当者、ステファニー・ノーン氏はその後、「インスタグラムによる犯罪の祝賀や称賛を禁じる」と声明を発表し、「我々が気づいている限り、爆撃の試みを称賛する内容を削除する」と述べた。「アカウント@hardrock2016 (アカウント@hardrock2016)のサスペンドに失敗したことについてTwitterからコメントを求めたが、Vergeは同社のプラットフォーム上での虐待行為を検討するための手順を5月から9月までにブログに掲載したと指摘した。 しかし、Twitterが今、謝罪を必要としていることを考えると、vitriolの浸透した文化やプラットフォーム上の憎悪について何もしなかったことについて、もう一度、そのシステムを再評価することになるだろう。[広告、Twitter]', `updated_at` = '2018-10-29 12:03:31' WHERE `articles`.`id` = 19[0m

Several Shabbat services were underway at the time of the attack. Six others were injured, including four police officers.According to the Associated Press, Bowers, who was injured in a shootout with responding officers, told a SWAT team member after surrendering that he wanted all Jews to die because they were committing “genocide” against his “people.”He was charged with 11 state counts of criminal homicide, six counts of aggravated assault, and 13 counts of ethnic intimidation, the AP reported. He also was charged with 29 federal criminal counts, including obstructing the free exercise of religious beliefs and using a firearm to commit murder. Obstructing the free exercise of religious beliefs is a hate crime.Bowers, who in recent months posted and shared anti-Semitic and anti-immigrant attacks and conspiracy theories on social media—including hours before the mass shooting—was armed with an AR-15 rifle and three Glock .357 handguns when he walked into the synagogue and began firing. Most of his victims were either middle-aged or the elderly, the oldest being 97.AdvertisementThe Allegheny County chief medical officer released the names of those killed, whose ages ranged from 54-97.Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto said the shooting was the “darkest day in Pittsburgh’s history.”Scott Brady, U.S. Attorney for the Western Pennsylvania District, added, “A place of worship is a sacred place, a place where a community comes together to celebrate what that they hold most dear, and this is our first freedom as a people…Today we stand together as a community, a community that rejects hatred and violence,” the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported.AdvertisementPeduto pointed out something that all mass shootings have in common: guns.“I think the approach we need to be looking at is how we take the guns, which is the common denominator of every mass shooting in America, out of the hands of those looking to express hatred and murder,” the mayor said.Peduto’s comments contrasted with remarks made on Saturday by President Donald Trump. Asked by a reporter at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland if he thought the country needed tougher gun laws, Trump dodged the question and blamed the synagogue for not having an armed guard. (The Tree of Life Synagogue normally keeps its doors locked during the week, but the doors were unlocked for Saturday services.)Advertisement“If they had protection inside, the results would have been far better…Maybe it could have been a much better situation,” Trump said.On Saturday night, after the Jewish Sabbath ended, thousands of local residents gathered to hold a candlelight vigil, singing songs in both Hebrew and English. The vigil was organized by high school students. One of the former worshipers at the church where the vigil began—the Sixth Presbyterian Church—was the late Fred “Mister” Rogers, the Post-Gazette noted.Advertisement“We gather because we are heartbroken but also to show zero tolerance for anti-Semitic speech, anti-Semitic behavior and anti-Semitic violence,” Rev.
